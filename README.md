# Magnanimous Numbers in Python 
  This repository will contain my solution for the [Rosseta Code](https://rosettacode.org/w/index.php?title=Rosetta_Code&oldid=322370) [Magnanimous Numbers Task](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Magnanimous_numbers) in Python
  There is alreasy a Python solution for this task; however it seems an interesting coding project and will provide an opportunity to practice creating a GitHub Project.  
## The Task
As described in the Rosseta Code page the task requirements are:

    * Write a routine (procedure, function, whatever) to find magnanimous numbers.
    * Use that function to find and display, here on this page the first 45 magnanimous numbers.
    * Use that function to find and display, here on this page the 241st through 250th magnanimous numbers.
    * Stretch: Use that function to find and display, here on this page the 391st through 400th magnanimous numbers

## Road Map
- [x] Create the Repository and README,
- [ ] Write a program (Magnanimous) to generate the first 45 Magnanimous numbers by default; the first Task objective,
- [ ] Implement code to achieve requirement 2 & 3 from above,
- [ ] Extend Magnanimous with a Command Line Interface (CLI) that will:
     - [ ] provide a help system,
     - [ ] check if a specific number is Magnanimous,
     - [ ] list Magnanimous numbers within a given range,
     - [ ] list a specified number of Magnanimous numbers from a speficed start position.
